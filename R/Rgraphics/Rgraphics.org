:     add r
:     rstudio
- Open up today's R script
  - In RStudio, Go to *File => Open Script*
  - Locate and open the =Rgraphics.R= script in the Rgraphics folder in your home directory
- Go to *Tools => Set working directory => To source file location* (more on the working directory later)
- I encourage you to add your own notes to this file!


** Workshop Overview

Class Structure and Organization:
- Ask questions at any time. Really!
- Collaboration is encouraged
- This is your class! Special requests are encouraged

This is an intermediate R course:
- Assumes working knowledge of R
- Relatively fast-paced
- Focus is on =ggplot2= graphics--other packages will not be covered


** Starting At The End
My goal: by the end of the workshop you will be able to reproduce this graphic from the Economist:

[[file:images/Economist1.png]]


** Why =ggplot2=?
Advantages of ggplot2
- consistent underlying =grammar of graphics= (Wilkinson, 2005)
- plot specification at a high level of abstraction
- very flexible
- theme system for polishing plot appearance
- mature and complete graphics system
- many users, active mailing list

That said, there are some things you cannot (or should not) do With ggplot2:
- 3-dimensional graphics (see the rgl package)
- Graph-theory type graphs (nodes/edges layout; see the igraph package)
- Interactive graphics (see the ggvis package)


** What Is The Grammar Of Graphics?

The basic idea: independently specify plot building blocks and combine them to create just about any kind of graphical display you want. Building blocks of a graph include:
- data
- aesthetic mapping
- geometric object
- statistical transformations
- scales
- coordinate system
- position adjustments
- faceting

** Example Data: =Housing prices=
Let's look at housing prices.
#+name: housingData
#+begin_src R
  housing <- read.csv("dataSets/landdata-states.csv")
  head(housing[1:5])
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: housingData
#+begin_example
> housing <- read.csv("dataSets/landdata-states.csv")
> head(housing[1:5])
  State region    Date Home.Value Structure.Cost
1    AK   West 2010.25     224952         160599
2    AK   West 2010.50     225511         160252
3    AK   West 2009.75     225820         163791
4    AK   West 2010.00     224994         161787
5    AK   West 2008.00     234590         155400
6    AK   West 2008.25     233714         157458 
#+end_example

** =ggplot2= VS Base Graphics
Compared to base graphics, =ggplot2=
- is more verbose for simple / canned graphics
- is less verbose for complex / custom graphics
- does not have methods (data should always be in a =data.frame=)
- uses a different system for adding plot elements


** =ggplot2= VS Base for simple graphs

Base graphics histogram example:

#+name: baseHist1
#+begin_src R :results graphics :file images/baseHist1.png 
  hist(housing$Home.Value)

#+end_src


#+RESULTS: baseHist1
[[file:images/baseHist1.png]]

=ggplot2= histogram example:

#+name: ggplotHist1
#+begin_src R :results graphics :file images/ggplotHist1.png 
  library(ggplot2)
  ggplot(housing, aes(x = Home.Value)) +
    geom_histogram()
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: ggplotHist1
[[file:images/ggplotHist1.png]]
Base wins!


** =ggplot2= Base graphics VS =ggplot= for more complex graphs:

Base colored scatter plot example:

#+name: baseComplex1
#+begin_src R :results graphics :file images/baseComplex1.png 
  plot(Home.Value ~ Date,
       data=subset(housing, State == "MA"))
  points(Home.Value ~ Date, col="red",
         data=subset(housing, State == "TX"))
  legend(1975, 400000,
         c("MA", "TX"), title="State",
         col=c("black", "red"),
         pch=c(1, 1))
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: baseComplex1
[[file:images/baseComplex1.png]]

=ggplot2= colored scatter plot example:

#+name: ggplotComplex1
#+begin_src R :results graphics :file images/ggplotComplex1.png
  ggplot(subset(housing, State %in% c("MA", "TX")),
         aes(x=Date,
             y=Home.Value,
             color=State))+
    geom_point()
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: ggplotComplex1
[[file:images/ggplotComplex1.png]]

 
=ggplot2=  wins!

* Geometric Objects And Aesthetics

** Aesthetic Mapping
In ggplot land /aesthetic/ means "something you can see". Examples include:
- position (i.e., on the x and y axes)
- color ("outside" color)
- fill ("inside" color)
- shape (of points)
- linetype
- size

Each type of geom accepts only a subset of all aesthetics--refer to the geom help pages to see what mappings each geom accepts. Aesthetic mappings are set with the =aes()= function.

** Geometic Objects (=geom=)
Geometric objects are the actual marks we put on a plot. Examples include:
- points (=geom_point=, for scatter plots, dot plots, etc)
- lines (=geom_line=, for time series, trend lines, etc)
- boxplot (=geom_boxplot=, for, well, boxplots!)
A plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. You can add a geom to a plot using the =+= operator

You can get a list of available geometric objects using the code below:
#+name: getListOfGeoms
#+begin_src R :eval no
  help.search("geom_", package = "ggplot2")
#+end_src
or simply type =geom_<tab>= in any good R IDE (such as Rstudio or ESS) to see a list of functions starting with =geom_=.

** Points (Scatterplot)
Now that we know about geometric objects and aesthetic mapping, we can make a ggplot. =geom_point= requires mappings for x and y, all others are optional.

#+name: ourFirstScatterplot
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/firstScatter.png 
  hp2001Q1 <- subset(housing, Date == 2001.25) 
  ggplot(hp2001Q1,
         aes(y = Structure.Cost, x = Land.Value)) +
    geom_point()
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: ourFirstScatterplot
[[file:images/firstScatter.png]]

#+name: ourFirstLogScatterplot
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/firstScatterLog.png 
  ggplot(hp2001Q1,
         aes(y = Structure.Cost, x = log(Land.Value))) +
    geom_point()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: ourFirstLogScatterplot
[[file:images/firstScatterLog.png]]

** Lines (Prediction Line)
A plot constructed with =ggplot= can have more than one geom. In that case the mappings established in the =ggplot()= call are plot defaults that can be added to or overridden. Our plot could use a regression line:

#+name: multipleLayers
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/housingLayers.png 
  hp2001Q1$pred.SC <- predict(lm(Structure.Cost ~ log(Land.Value), data = hp2001Q1))

  p1 <- ggplot(hp2001Q1, aes(x = log(Land.Value), y = Structure.Cost))

  p1 + geom_point(aes(color = Home.Value)) +
    geom_line(aes(y = pred.SC))
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: multipleLayers
[[file:images/housingLayers.png]]

** Smoothers 
Not all geometric objects are simple shapes--the smooth geom includes a line and a ribbon.

#+name: multipleLayers2
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/housingLayers2.png 
  p1 +
    geom_point(aes(color = Home.Value)) +
    geom_smooth()
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: multipleLayers2
[[file:images/housingLayers2.png]]

** Text (Label Points)
Each =geom= accepts a particualar set of mappings--for example =geom_text()= accepts a =labels= mapping.

#+name: textGeomMapping2
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/textGeomMapping.png 
  p1 + 
    geom_text(aes(label=State), size = 3)
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: textGeomMapping2
[[file:images/textGeomMapping.png]]


#+name: textGeomMapping3
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/textGeomMapping2.png
  ## install.packages("ggrepel") 
  library("ggrepel")
  p1 + 
    geom_point() + 
    geom_text_repel(aes(label=State), size = 3)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: textGeomMapping3
[[file:images/textGeomMapping2.png]]

** Aesthetic Mapping VS Assignment
Note that variables are mapped to aesthetics with the =aes()= function, while fixed aesthetics are set outside the =aes()= call. This sometimes leads to confusion, as in this example:

#+name: housingMapping
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/housing2.png 
  p1 +
    geom_point(aes(size = 2),# incorrect! 2 is not a variable
               color="red") # this is fine -- all points red
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: housingMapping
[[file:images/housing2.png]]


** Mapping Variables To Other Aesthetics 
Other aesthetics are mapped in the same way as x and y in the previous example.

#+name: colorAndSizeAes
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/addColorAndShapeMapping.png 
  p1 +
    geom_point(aes(color=Home.Value, shape = region))
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: colorAndSizeAes
[[file:images/addColorAndShapeMapping.png]]

** Exercise I

The data for the exercises is available in the ~dataSets/EconomistData.csv~ file. Read it in with 
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  dat <- read.csv("dataSets/EconomistData.csv")
  head(dat)

  ggplot(dat, aes(x = CPI, y = HDI, size = HDI.Rank)) + geom_point()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> dat <- read.csv("dataSets/EconomistData.csv")
> 
#+end_example

Original sources for these data are
  http://www.transparency.org/content/download/64476/1031428
  http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/indicators/display_cf_xls_indicator.cfm?indicator_id=103106&lang=en

These data consist of /Human Development Index/ and /Corruption Perception Index/ scores for several countries.

1. Create a scatter plot with CPI on the x axis and HDI on the y axis.
2. Color the points blue.
3. Map the color of the the points to Region.
4. Make the points bigger by setting size to 2
5. Map the size of the points to HDI.Rank

** Exercise I prototype                                          :prototype:
1. [@1] Create a scatter plot with CPI on the x axis and HDI on the y axis.
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent
  ggplot(dat, aes(x = CPI, y = HDI)) +
    geom_point()
#+END_SRC
2. [@2] Color the points in the previous plot blue.
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent
  ggplot(dat, aes(x = CPI, y = HDI)) +
    geom_point(color = "blue")
#+END_SRC
3. [@3] Color the points in the previous plot according to /Region/.
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent
  ggplot(dat, aes(x = CPI, y = HDI)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = Region))
#+END_SRC
4. [@4] Make the points bigger by setting size to 2
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent
  ggplot(dat, aes(x = CPI, y = HDI)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = Region), size = 2)
#+END_SRC
5. [@5] Make the points bigger by setting size to 2
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent
    ggplot(dat, aes(x = CPI, y = HDI)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = Region, size =  HDI.Rank))
#+END_SRC
* Statistical Transformations

** Statistical Transformations
Some plot types (such as scatterplots) do not require transformations--each point is plotted at x and y coordinates equal to the original value. Other plots, such as boxplots, histograms, prediction lines etc. require statistical transformations:
- for a boxplot the y values must be transformed to the median and 1.5(IQR)
- for a smoother smother the y values must be transformed into predicted values

Each =geom= has a default statistic, but these can be changed. For example, the default statistic for =geom_bar= is =stat_bin=:
#+name: geomHistorgramArgs
#+begin_src R
  args(geom_histogram)
  args(stat_bin)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: geomHistorgramArgs
#+begin_example
> args(geom_histogram)
function (mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "bin", binwidth = NULL, 
    bins = NULL, origin = NULL, right = FALSE, position = "stack", 
    na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = NA, inherit.aes = TRUE, ...) 
NULL
> args(stat_bin)
function (mapping = NULL, data = NULL, geom = "bar", position = "stack", 
    width = 0.9, drop = FALSE, right = FALSE, binwidth = NULL, 
    bins = NULL, origin = NULL, breaks = NULL, na.rm = FALSE, 
    show.legend = NA, inherit.aes = TRUE, ...) 
NULL
> 
#+end_example

** Setting Statistical Transformation Arguments
Arguments to =stat_= functions can be passed through =geom_= functions. This can be slightly annoying because in order to change it you have to first determine which stat the geom uses, then determine the arguments to that stat. 

For example, here is the default histogram of Home.Value:
#+name: GeomBinDefaults
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/GeomBinDefaults.png 
  p2 <- ggplot(housing, aes(x = Home.Value))
  p2 + geom_histogram()
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: GeomBinDefaults
[[file:images/GeomBinDefaults.png]]
The binwidth looks reasonable by default, but we can change it by passing the =binwidth= argument to the =stat_bin= function:
#+name: ChangeStatBinArgs
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/ChangeStatBinArgs.png 
  p2 + geom_histogram(stat = "bin", binwidth=4000)
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: ChangeStatBinArgs
[[file:images/ChangeStatBinArgs.png]]

** Changing The Statistical Transformation
Sometimes the default statistical transformation is not what you need. This is often the case with pre-summarized data:
#+name: summarizeMTC
#+begin_src R
  housing.sum <- aggregate(housing["Home.Value"], housing["State"], FUN=mean)
  rbind(head(housing.sum), tail(housing.sum))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: summarizeMTC
#+begin_example
> housing.sum <- aggregate(housing["Home.Value"], housing["State"], FUN=mean)
> rbind(head(housing.sum), tail(housing.sum))
   State Home.Value
1     AK     147385
2     AL      92545
3     AR      82077
4     AZ     140756
5     CA     282808
6     CO     158176
46    VA     155391
47    VT     132395
48    WA     178523
49    WI     108359
50    WV      77162
51    WY     122897
> 
#+end_example

#+begin_src R
  ggplot(housing.sum, aes(x=State, y=Home.Value)) + 
    geom_bar()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

#+begin_example
  ggplot(housing.sum, aes(x=State, y=Home.Value)) + 
    geom_bar()
  Error: stat_count() must not be used with a y aesthetic.
#+end_example

What is the problem with the previous plot? Basically we take binned and summarized data and ask ggplot to bin and summarize it again (remember, =geom_bar= defaults to =stat = stat_count=); obviously this will not work. We can fix it by telling =geom_bar= to use a different statistical transformation function:
#+name: BarPlotSum1
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/ChangeStat.png
  ggplot(housing.sum, aes(x=State, y=Home.Value)) + 
    geom_bar(stat="identity")
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: BarPlotSum1
[[file:images/ChangeStat.png]]

** Exercise II

1. Re-create a scatter plot with CPI on the x axis and HDI on the y axis (as you did in the previous exercise).
2. Overlay a smoothing line on top of the scatter plot using =geom_smooth=.
3. Overlay a smoothing line on top of the scatter plot using =geom_smooth=, but use a linear model for the predictions. Hint: see =?stat_smooth=.
4. Overlay a smoothing line on top of the scatter plot using =geom_line=. Hint: change the statistical transformation.
5. BONUS: Overlay a smoothing line on top of the scatter plot using the default /loess/ method, but make it less smooth. Hint: see =?loess=.

    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(span = .4)
#+END_SRC

* Scales

** Scales: Controlling Aesthetic Mapping
Aesthetic mapping (i.e., with =aes()=) only says that a variable should be mapped to an aesthetic. It doesn't say /how/ that should happen. For example, when mapping a variable to /shape/ with =aes(shape = x)= you don't say /what/ shapes should be used. Similarly, =aes(color = z)= doesn't say /what/ colors should be used. Describing what colors/shapes/sizes etc. to use is done by modifying the corresponding /scale/. In =ggplot2= scales include
- position
- color and fill
- size
- shape
- line type
Scales are modified with a series of functions using a =scale_<aesthetic>_<type>= naming scheme. Try typing =scale_<tab>= to see a list of scale modification functions.

** Common Scale Arguments
The following arguments are common to most scales in ggplot2:
- name :: the first argument gives the axis or legend title
- limits :: the minimum and maximum of the scale
- breaks :: the points along the scale where labels should appear
- labels :: the labels that appear at each break

Specific scale functions may have additional arguments; for example, the =scale_color_continuous= function has arguments =low= and =high= for setting the colors at the low and high end of the scale.

** Scale Modification Examples

Start by constructing a dotplot showing the distribution of home values by Date and State.

#+name: modifyScales1
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/modifyScales1.png :width 800 
  p3 <- ggplot(housing,
               aes(x = State,
                   y = Home.Price.Index)) + 
          theme(legend.position="top",
                axis.text=element_text(size = 6))
  (p4 <- p3 + geom_point(aes(color = Date),
                         alpha = 0.5,
                         size = 1.5,
                         position = position_jitter(width = 0.25, height = 0)))
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: modifyScales1
[[file:images/modifyScales1.png]]

Now modify the breaks for the x axis and color scales

#+name: modifyScales2
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/modifyScales2.png  :width 800
  p4 + scale_x_discrete(name="State Abbreviation") +
    scale_color_continuous(name="",
                           breaks = c(1976, 1994, 2013),
                           labels = c("'76", "'94", "'13"))
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: modifyScales2
[[file:images/modifyScales2.png]]

Next change the low and high values to blue and red:
#+name: modifyScales3
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/modifyScales3.png :width 800
  p4 +
    scale_x_discrete(name="State Abbreviation") +
    scale_color_continuous(name="",
                           breaks = c(1976, 1994, 2013),
                           labels = c("'76", "'94", "'13"),
                           low = "blue", high = "red")

#+end_src


#+RESULTS: modifyScales3
[[file:images/modifyScales3.png]]

#+name: modifyScales3b
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/modifyScales3b.png :width 800
  p4 +
    scale_color_continuous(name="",
                           breaks = c(1976, 1994, 2013),
                           labels = c("'76", "'94", "'13"),
                           low = muted("blue"), high = muted("red"))

#+end_src

#+RESULTS: modifyScales3b
[[file:images/modifyScales3b.png]]

** Using different color scales
ggplot2 has a wide variety of color scales; here is an example using =scale_color_gradient2= to interpolate between three different colors.
#+name: modifyScales4
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/modifyScales4.png :width 800

** Exercise III
1. Create a scatter plot with CPI on the x axis and HDI on the y axis. Color the points to indicate region.
2. Modify the x, y, and color scales so that they have more easily-understood names (e.g., spell out "Human development Index" instead of "HDI").
3. Modify the color scale to use specific values of your choosing. Hint: see =?scale_color_manual=.

* Faceting

** Faceting
- Faceting is =ggplot2= parlance for *small multiples*
- The idea is to create separate graphs for subsets of data
- =ggplot2= offers two functions for creating small multiples:
 1. =facet_wrap()=: define subsets as the levels of a single grouping variable
 2. =facet_grid()=: define subsets as the crossing of two grouping variables
- Facilitates comparison among plots, not just of geoms within a plot


** What is the trend in housing prices in each state?
- Start by using a technique we already know--map State to color:
#+name: housingscatter
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/housing1.png 
  p5 <- ggplot(housing, aes(x = Date, y = Home.Value))
  p5 + geom_line(aes(color = State))  
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: housingscatter
[[file:images/housing1.png]]

There are two problems here--there are too many states to distinguish each one by color, and the lines obscure one another.

** Faceting to the rescue
We can remedy the deficiencies of the previous plot by faceting by state rather than mapping state to color.

#+name: housingscatter2
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/housingfoo2.png :width 800 :height 650
  (p5 <- p5 + geom_line() +
     facet_wrap(~State, ncol = 10))
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: housingscatter2
[[file:images/housingfoo2.png]]

There is also a ~facet_grid()~ function for faceting in two dimensions.

* Themes

** Themes
The ~ggplot2~ theme system handles non-data plot elements such as
- Axis labels
- Plot background
- Facet label backround
- Legend appearance
Built-in themes include:
  - =theme_gray()= (default)
  - =theme_bw()=
  - =theme_classc()=
#+name: themex1
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/themeex1.png :width 800 :height 650
  p5 + theme_linedraw()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: themex1
[[file:images/themeex1.png]]


#+name: themex2
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/themeex2.png :width 800 :height 650
  p5 + theme_light()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: themex2
[[file:images/themeex2.png]]

** Overriding theme defaults
Specific theme elements can be overridden using ~theme()~. For example:
#+name: opts
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/opts.png :width 800 :height 650
    p5 + theme_minimal() +
      theme(text = element_text(color = "turquoise"))
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: opts
[[file:images/opts.png]]

All theme options are documented in =?theme=.

** Creating and saving new themes
You can create new themes, as in the following example:

#+name: themes
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/themes.png :width 800 :height 650
  theme_new <- theme_bw() +
    theme(plot.background = element_rect(size = 1, color = "blue", fill = "black"),
          text=element_text(size = 12, family = "Serif", color = "ivory"),
          axis.text.y = element_text(colour = "purple"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(colour = "red"),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = "pink"),
          strip.background = element_rect(fill = muted("orange")))
  
  p5 + theme_new
#+end_src



#+RESULTS: themes
[[file:images/themes.png]]

* The #1 FAQ

* Putting It All Together

** Challenge: Recreate This =Economist= Graph

[[file:images/Economist1.pdf]]

Graph source: http://www.economist.com/node/21541178

Building off of the graphics you created in the previous exercises, put the finishing touches to make it as close as possible to the original economist graph.

[[file:images/Economist1.png]]




* Challenge Solution                                              :prototype:

Lets start by creating the basic scatter plot, then we can make a list of things that need to be added or changed. The basic plot loogs like this:

#+name: econDatScatter
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/econScatter1.png 
  dat <- read.csv("dataSets/EconomistData.csv")

  pc1 <- ggplot(dat, aes(x = CPI, y = HDI, color = Region))
  pc1 + geom_point()
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: econDatScatter
[[file:images/econScatter1.png]]

To complete this graph we need to:
- [ ] add a trend line
- [ ] change the point shape to open circle
- [ ] change the order and labels of Region
- [ ] label select points
- [ ] fix up the tick marks and labels
- [ ] move color legend to the top
- [ ] title, label axes, remove legend title
- [ ] theme the graph with no vertical guides
- [ ] add model R^2 (hard)
- [ ] add sources note (hard)
- [ ] final touches to make it perfect (use image editor for this)

** Adding the trend line

Adding the trend line is not too difficult, though we need to guess at the model being displyed on the graph. A little bit of trial and error leds to 
#+name: econDatScatter2
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/econScatter2.png 
  (pc2 <- pc1 +
     geom_smooth(aes(group = 1),
                 method = "lm",
                 formula = y ~ log(x),
                 se = FALSE,
                 color = "red")) +
     geom_point()
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: econDatScatter2
[[file:images/econScatter2.png]]

Notice that we put the =geom_line= layer first so that it will be plotted underneath the points, as was done on the original graph.

** Use open points
This one is a little tricky. We know that we can change the shape with the =shape= argument, what what value do we set shape to? The example shown in =?shape= can help us:
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :file images/shapes.png
  ## A look at all 25 symbols
  df2 <- data.frame(x = 1:5 , y = 1:25, z = 1:25)
  s <- ggplot(df2, aes(x = x, y = y))
  s + geom_point(aes(shape = z), size = 4) + scale_shape_identity()
  ## While all symbols have a foreground colour, symbols 19-25 also take a
  ## background colour (fill)
  s + geom_point(aes(shape = z), size = 4, colour = "Red") +
    scale_shape_identity()
  s + geom_point(aes(shape = z), size = 4, colour = "Red", fill = "Black") +
    scale_shape_identity()

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/shapes.png]]

This shows us that /shape 1/ is an open circle, so
#+name: econDatScatter3
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/econScatter3.png 
  pc2 +
    geom_point(shape = 1, size = 4)
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: econDatScatter3
[[file:images/econScatter3.png]]

That is better, but unfortunately the size of the line around the points is much narrower than on the original.

#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/econScatter3b.png 
  (pc3 <- pc2 + geom_point(shape = 1, size = 2.5, stroke = 1.25))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/econScatter3b.png]]

** Labelling points
This one is tricky in a couple of ways. First, there is no attribute in the data that separates points that should be labelled from points that should not be. So the first step is to identify those points. 
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent
  pointsToLabel <- c("Russia", "Venezuela", "Iraq", "Myanmar", "Sudan",
                     "Afghanistan", "Congo", "Greece", "Argentina", "Brazil",
                     "India", "Italy", "China", "South Africa", "Spane",
                     "Botswana", "Cape Verde", "Bhutan", "Rwanda", "France",
                     "United States", "Germany", "Britain", "Barbados", "Norway", "Japan",hh
                     "New Zealand", "Singapore")
#+END_SRC

Now we can label these points using =geom_text=, like this:

#+END_SRC
#+name: econDatScatter4
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/econScatter4.png :width 800 :height 600
  (pc4 <- pc3 +
    geom_text(aes(label = Country),
              color = "gray20",
              data = subset(dat, Country %in% pointsToLabel)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: econDatScatter4
[[file:images/econScatter4.png]]

This more or less gets the information across, but the labels overlap in a most unpleasing fashion. We can use the =ggrepel= package to make things better, but if you want perfection you will probably have to do some hand-adjustment.

#+name: econDatScatter5
#+begin_src R :results output graphics :file images/econScatter4b.png :width 800 :height 600
  library("ggrepel")
  (pc4 <- pc3 +
     geom_text_repel(aes(label = Country),
                     color = "gray20",
                     data = subset(dat, Country %in% pointsToLabel),
                     force = 10))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: econDatScatter5
[[file:images/econScatter4b.png]]

** Change the region labels and order
Thinkgs are starting to come together. There are just a couple more things we need to add, and then all that will be left are themeing changes. 

Comparing our graph to the original we notice that the labels and order of the Regions in the color legend differ. To correct this we need to change both the labels and order of the Region variable. We can do this with the =factor= function.
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent
  dat$Region <- factor(dat$Region,
                       levels = c("EU W. Europe",
                                  "Americas",
                                  "Asia Pacific",
                                  "East EU Cemt Asia",
                                  "MENA",
                                  "SSA"),
                       labels = c("OECD",
                                  "Americas",
                                  "Asia &\nOceania",
                                  "Central &\nEastern Europe",
                                  "Middle East &\nnorth Africa",
                                  "Sub-Saharan\nAfrica"))
                                
#+END_SRC 

Now when we construct the plot using these data the order should appear as it does in the original.
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :file images/econScatter6.png :width 800 :height 600
  pc4$data <- dat
  pc4
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/econScatter6.png]]


** Add title and format axes

The next step is to add the title and format the axes. We do that using the =scales= system in ggplot2.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :file images/econScatter7.png :width 800 :height 500
  library(grid)
  (pc5 <- pc4 +
    scale_x_continuous(name = "Corruption Perceptions Index, 2011 (10=least corrupt)",
                       limits = c(.9, 10.5),
                       breaks = 1:10) +
    scale_y_continuous(name = "Human Development Index, 2011 (1=Best)",
                       limits = c(0.2, 1.0),
                       breaks = seq(0.2, 1.0, by = 0.1)) +
    scale_color_manual(name = "",
                       values = c("#24576D",
                                  "#099DD7",
                                  "#28AADC",
                                  "#248E84",
                                  "#F2583F",
                                  "#96503F")) +
    ggtitle("Corruption and Human development"))

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/econScatter7.png]]

** Theme tweaks
Our graph is almost there. To finish up, we need to adjust some of the theme elements, and label the axes and legends. This part usually involves some trial and error as you figure out where things need to be positioned. To see what these various theme settings do you can change them and observe the results.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :file images/econScatter8.png :width 900 :height 600
  library(grid) # for the 'unit' function
  (pc6 <- pc5 +
    theme_minimal() + # start with a minimal theme and add what we need
    theme(text = element_text(color = "gray20"),
          legend.position = c("top"), # position the legend in the upper left 
          legend.direction = "horizontal",
          legend.justification = 0.1, # anchor point for legend.position.
          legend.text = element_text(size = 11, color = "gray10"),
          axis.text = element_text(face = "italic"),
          axis.title.x = element_text(vjust = -1), # move title away from axis
          axis.title.y = element_text(vjust = 2), # move away for axis
          axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), # element_blank() is how we remove elements
          axis.line = element_line(color = "gray40", size = 0.5),
          axis.line.y = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray50", size = 0.5),
          panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()
          ))

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/econScatter8.png]]

** Add model R^2 and source note
The last bit of information that we want to have on the graph is the variance explained by the model represented by the trend line. Lets fit that model and pull out the R^2 first, then think about how to get it onto the graph.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  (mR2 <- summary(lm(HDI ~ log(CPI), data = dat))$r.squared)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> (mR2 <- summary(lm(HDI ~ log(CPI), data = dat))$r.squared)
[1] 0.5212859
> 
#+end_example

OK, now that we've calculated the values, let's think about how to get them on the graph. ggplot2 has an =annotate= function, but this is not convenient for adding elements outside the plot area. The =grid= package has nice functions for doing this, so we'll use those.

And here it is, our final version!

#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent
  library(grid)
  png(file = "images/econScatter10.png", width = 800, height = 600)
  pc6 
  grid.text("Sources: Transparency International; UN Human Development Report",
           x = .02, y = .03,
           just = "left",
           draw = TRUE)
  grid.segments(x0 = 0.81, x1 = 0.825,
                y0 = 0.90, y1 = 0.90,
                gp = gpar(col = "red"),
                draw = TRUE)
  grid.text(paste0("R² = ",
                   as.integer(mR2*100),
                   "%"),
            x = 0.835, y = 0.90,
            gp = gpar(col = "gray20"),
            draw = TRUE,
            just = "left")

  dev.off()
#+END_SRC

[[file:images/econScatter10.png]]

Comparing it to the original suggests that we've got most of the important elements, though of course the two graphs are not identical.
