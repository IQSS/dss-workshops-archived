** What is R?
R is a /programming language designed for statistical computing/. Notable characteristics include:
- Vast capabilities, wide range of statistical and graphical techniques
- Very popular in academia, growing popularity in business: [[http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/]]
- Written primarily by statisticians
- FREE (no cost, open source)
- Excellent community support: mailing list, blogs, tutorials
- Easy to extend by writing new functions

** InspiRation 
OK, it's free and popular, but what makes R worth learning? In a word,
"packages". If you have a data manipulation, analysis or visualization
task, chances are good that there is an R package for that. For example:

- Want to find out where we are?
#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :results output graphics :width 600 :height 600 :file images/hereweare.png
  library(ggmap)
  nwbuilding <- geocode("1737 Cambridge Street Cambridge, MA 02138", source = "google") 
  ggmap(get_map("Cambridge, MA", zoom = 15)) +
    geom_point(data=nwbuilding, size = 7, shape = 13, color = "red")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/hereweare.png]]

- Want to forecast the population of Australia?
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :width 400 :pointsize 3 :res 200 :height 250 :file images/austop.png
  library(forecast)
  fit <- auto.arima(austres)
  ## Projected numbers (in thousands) of Australian residents
  plot(forecast(fit))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/austop.png]]


- Want to interactively explore the shape of the Churyumov–Gerasimenko comet?
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent
  library(plotly)
  comet <- rgl::readOBJ(url("http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/doc.cfm?fobjectid=54726"))

  comet.plot <- plot_ly(x = comet$vb[1,],
                        y = comet$vb[2,],
                        z = comet$vb[3,],
                        i = comet$it[1,]-1,
                        j= comet$it[2,]-1,
                        k = comet$it[3,]-1,
                        type = "mesh3d")

  setwd("images")
  htmlwidgets::saveWidget(comet.plot, file = "comet.html")
  setwd("..")

  comet.plot
#+END_SRC

#+HTML: <iframe src="images/comet.html" width=600 height=350 scrolling=no seamless></iframe>

Whatever you're trying to do, you're probably not the first to try doing it R. Chances are good that someone has already written a package for that.

** Coming to R
Coming from...
- Stata :: http://www.princeton.edu/~otorres/RStata.pdf
- SAS/SPSS :: http://www.et.bs.ehu.es/~etptupaf/pub/R/RforSAS&SPSSusers.pdf

* Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)


** R GUI alternatives

The old-school way is to run R directly in a terminal

#+attr_html: :width 95%
[[file:images/Rconsole.png]]

But hardly anybody does it that way anymore! The Windows version of R comes with a GUI that looks like this:

#+attr_html: :width 95%
[[file:images/Rgui.png]]

The default windows GUI is not very good
  - No parentheses matching or syntax highlighting
  - No work-space browser

RStudio (an alternative GUI for R) is shown below.
#+attr_html: :width 95%
[[file:images/Rstudio.png]]

Rstudio has many useful features, including parentheses matching and auto-completion. Rstudio is not the only advanced R interface; other alteratives include Emacs with ESS (shown below).

#+attr_html: :width 95%
[[file:images/emacs.png]]

Emacs + ESS is a very powerful combination, but can be difficult to set up.

#+attr_html: :width 95%
[[file:images/Jupyter.png]]

Jupyter is a notebook interface that runs in your web browser. A lot of people like it. You can access these workshop notes as a Jupyter notebook at http://tutorials-live.iq.harvard.edu:8000/notebooks/workshops/R/Rintro/Rintro.ipynb

** Launch RStudio on Athena					   :mitsetup:

- To start R *type these commands in the terminal*:
:     add r
:     rstudio
- Open up today's R script
  - In RStudio, Go to *File => Open Script*
  - Locate and open the =Rintro.R= script in the Rintro folder in your home directory
- Go to *Session => Set working directory => To source file location* (more on the working directory later)
- I encourage you to add your own notes to this file!


** Launch RStudio 						   :labsetup:

- Open the RStudio program
- Open up today's R script
  - In RStudio, Go to *File => Open Script*
  - Locate and open the =Rintro.R= script in the Rintro folder on your desktop
- Go to *Tools => Set working directory => To source file location* (more on the working directory later)
- I encourage you to add your own notes to this file! Every line that starts with =#= is a comment that will be ignored by R. My comments all start with =##=; you can add your own, possibly using =#= or =###= to distinguish your comments from mine.  


** Exercise 0
The purpose of this exercise is mostly to give you an opportunity to explore the interface provided by RStudio (or whichever GUI you've decided to use). You may not know how to do these things; that's fine! This is an opportunity to learn. If you don't know how to do something you can can use internet search engines, search on [[http:stackoverflow.com][StackOverflow]], or ask the person next to you.

Also keep in mind that we are living in a golden age of tab completion. If you don't know the name of an R function, try guessing the first two or three letters and pressing TAB. If you guessed correctly the function you are looking for should appear in a pop up! 

1. Try to get R to add 2 plus 2.
2. Try to calculate the square root of 10.
3. There is an R package named =car= (Companion to Applied Regression). Try to install this package.
4. R includes extensive documentation, including a file named "An introduction to R". Try to find this help file.
5. Open a web browser, go to [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/]] and skim the topic closest to your field/interests.

** Exercise 0 solution                                            :prototype:
1) [@1]] Add 2 plus 2.
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output replace
  2 + 2
  sum(2, 2)

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> 2 + 2
[1] 4
> sum(2, 2)
[1] 4
> 
#+end_example

2) [@2] Calculate the square root of 10:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  sqrt(10)
  10^(1/2)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> sqrt(10)
[1] 3.162278
> 10^(1/2)
[1] 3.162278
> 
#+end_example

3) [@3] Install the "car" package:

=In Rstudio, go to the "Packages" tab and click the "Istall" button. Search in the pop-up window and click "Install".=

4) [@4] Find "An Introduction to R".

=Go to the main help page by running 'help.start() or using the GUI menu, find and click on the link to "An Introduction to R".=

* Data and Functions

** Assignment

Values can be assigned names and used in subsequent operations
- The ~<-~ operator (less than followed by a dash) is used to save values
- The name on the left gets the value on the right.

#+name: firstRExample
#+begin_src R 
  x <- 10 # Assign the value 10 to a variable named x
  x + 1 # Add 1 to x
  x # note that x is unchanged
  y <- x + 1 # Assign y the value x + 1
  y
  x <- x + 100 # change the value of x
  y ## note that y is unchanged.
#+end_src


#+RESULTS: firstRExample
#+begin_example
> x <- 10 # Assign the value 10 to a variable named x
> x + 1 # Add 1 to x
[1] 11
> x # note that x is unchanged
[1] 10
> y <- x + 1 # Assign y the value x + 1
> y
[1] 11
> x <- x + 100 # change the value of x
> y ## note that y is unchanged.
[1] 11
> 
#+end_example


Saved variables can be listed, overwritten and deleted
#+name: listOverwriteDelete
#+begin_src R
  ls() # List variables in workspace
  x # Print the value of x
  x <- 100 # Overwrite x. Note that no warning is given!
  x
  rm(x) # Delete x
  ls()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: listOverwriteDelete
#+begin_example
> ls() # List variables in workspace
[1] "comet"      "comet.plot" "filter"     "fit"        "nwbuilding"
[6] "x"          "y"         
> x # Print the value of x
[1] 110
> x <- 100 # Overwrite x. Note that no warning is given!
> x
[1] 100
> rm(x) # Delete x
> ls()
[1] "comet"      "comet.plot" "filter"     "fit"        "nwbuilding"
[6] "y"         
> 
#+end_example

** Data types and conversion
The =x= and =y= data objects we created are numeric /vectors/ of length one. Vectors are the simplest data structure in R, and are the building blocks used to make more complex data structures. Here are some more vector examples.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  x <- c(10, 11, 12)
  X <- c("10", "11", "12")
  y <- c("h", "e", "l", "l", "o")
  Y <- "hello"
  z <- c(1, 0, 1, 1)
  Z <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> x <- c(10, 11, 12)
> X <- c("10", "11", "12")
> y <- c("h", "e", "l", "l", "o")
> Y <- "hello"
> z <- c(1, 0, 1, 1)
> Z <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
> 
#+end_example

Notice that the =c= function combines its arguments into a vector.

All R objects have a /mode/ and /length/. Since it is impossible for an object not to have these attributes they are called /intrinsic attributes/.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  print(x)
  mode(x)
  length(x)
  
  print(X)
  mode(X)
  length(X)

  length(y)
  length(Y)
  
  mode(z)
  mode(Z)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> print(x)
[1] 10 11 12
> mode(x)
[1] "numeric"
> length(x)
[1] 3
> 
> print(X)
[1] "10" "11" "12"
> mode(X)
[1] "character"
> length(X)
[1] 3
> 
> length(y)
[1] 5
> length(Y)
[1] 1
> 
> mode(z)
[1] "numeric"
> mode(Z)
[1] "logical"
> 
#+end_example

Data structures in R can be converted from one type to another using one of the many functions beginning with =as.=. For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  mode(x)
  mode(as.character(x))
  mode(X)
  mode(as.numeric(X))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> mode(x)
[1] "numeric"
> mode(as.character(x))
[1] "character"
> mode(X)
[1] "character"
> mode(as.numeric(X))
[1] "numeric"
> 
#+end_example


** Functions
Using R is mostly about applying *functions* to *variables*. Functions
  - take *variable(s)* as input *argument(s)*
  - perform operations
  - *return* values which can be *assigned*
  - optionally perform side-effects such as writing a file to disk or opening a graphics window

The general form for calling R functions is 
#+BEGIN_SRC R :eval no
  ## FunctionName(arg.1, arg.2, ..., arg.n)
#+END_SRC

Arguments can be matched by position or name

Examples:
#+name: functionExamples
#+begin_src R
  #?sqrt
  a <- sqrt(z) # Call the sqrt function with argument x=z
  
## look at the arguments to the round function
  args(round) # use ?round if you need more information

  round(a, digits = 2) # Call round() with arguments x=x and digits=2

  ## since matching by name takes precedence these are all equivalent:
  round(a, 2)
  round(x = a, 2)
  round(digits = 2, x = a)

  ## the only way we can go wrong is by omiting the names and mixing up the order
  round(2, x)

  # Functions can be nested so an alternative is
  round(sqrt(z), digits = 2) # Take sqrt of a and round
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: functionExamples
#+begin_example
>   #?sqrt
>   a <- sqrt(z) # Call the sqrt function with argument x=z
>   
> ## look at the arguments to the round function
>   args(round) # use ?round if you need more information
function (x, digits = 0) 
NULL
> 
>   round(a, digits = 2) # Call round() with arguments x=x and digits=2
[1] 1 0 1 1
> 
>   ## since matching by name takes precedence these are all equivalent:
>   round(a, 2)
[1] 1 0 1 1
>   round(x = a, 2)
[1] 1 0 1 1
>   round(digits = 2, x = a)
[1] 1 0 1 1
> 
>   ## the only way we can go wrong is by omiting the names and mixing up the order
>   round(2, x)
[1] 2 2 2
> 
>   # Functions can be nested so an alternative is
>   round(sqrt(z), digits = 2) # Take sqrt of a and round
[1] 1 0 1 1
> 
#+end_example
  
* Asking R for help
R has extensive built-in documentation that can be accessed through R commands or through the GUI.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :eval no
  ## Start html help, search/browse using web browser
  help.start() # or use the help menu from you GUI
  ## Look up the documentation for a function
  help(plot) ## or use the shortcut: ?plot
  ## Look up documentation for a package
  help(package="stats")
  ## Search documentation from R (not always the best way... google often works better)
  help.search("classification")

#+END_SRC


* R packages

There are thousands of R packages that extend R's capabilities. Some packages are distributed with R, and some of these are attached to the search path by default. Many more are available in package repositories.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :eval no
  ##To see what packages are loaded: 
  search()

  ## To view available packages: 
  library()

  ## To load a package: 
  library("MASS")

  ## Install new package: 
  install.packages("stringdist")

#+END_SRC

In this workshop we will use the /tidyverse/ package. /tidyverse/ is a meta package that loads the /dplyr/ package for easier data manipulation the /readr/ package for easier data import/export, and several other useful packages.

** Exercise 1
The purpose of this exercise is to practice using the package management and help facilities. 

1. Use the =search= function to inspect the current search path. Assign the result to the name =orig.search.path=.
2. What are the =mode= and =length= of =orig.search.path=?
3. Install the /tidyverse/ package. Compare the output of =search()= to the value you've saved in =orig.search.path=. Has it changed?
4. Use the =library= function to attach the /tidyverse/ package. Compare the output of =search()= to the value you've saved in =orig.search.path=. Has it changed?
5. Look up the help page for the /readr/ package. Which function would you use to read a tab delimited file?

** Exercise 1 solution                                            :prototype:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  ## inspect search path
  search()
  orig.search.path <- search()
  
  ## install the tidyverse package and check search path
  # install.pacakges("tidyverse")
  search() ## unchanged

  ## attach the tidyverse pacakge
  library("tidyverse")
  print(orig.search.path)
  search() ## different now that we have attached the package using the library function

  ## look up the readr package documentation
  help(package = "readr")
  ## I would use read_tsv to read a tab delimited file.

* Getting data into R
  
** The baby names data set 
The examples in this workshop use the baby names data provided by the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom. A cleaned and merged version of these data is in =dataSets/babyNames.csv=.

** The "working directory" and listing files
 R knows the directory it was started in, and refers to this as the "working directory". Since our workshop examples are in the Rintro folder in your Downloads folder, we should all take a moment to set that as our working directory.

#+name: SetDesktopWorkingDirectory
#+begin_src R :eval no
  getwd() # what is my current working directory?
  # setwd("~/Desktop/Rintro") # change directory
#+end_src

Note that "=~=" means "my home directory" but that this can mean different things on different operating systems. You can also use the Files tab in Rstudio to navigate to a directory, then click "More -> Set as working directory".

We can a set the working directory using paths relative to the current working directory. Once we are in the "Rintro" folder we can navigate to the "dataSets" folder like this:

#+name: getWD
#+begin_src R
  getwd() # get the current working directory
  setwd("dataSets") # set wd to the dataSets folder
  getwd()
  setwd("..") # set wd to enclosing folder ("up")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: getWD
#+begin_example
> getwd() # get the current working directory
[1] "/home/izahn/Documents/Work/Classes/IQSS_Stats_Workshops/R/Rintro"
> setwd("dataSets") # set wd to the dataSets folder
> getwd()
[1] "/home/izahn/Documents/Work/Classes/IQSS_Stats_Workshops/R/Rintro/dataSets"
> setwd("..") # set wd to enclosing folder ("up")
> 
#+end_example

 It can be convenient to list files in a directory without leaving R
#+name: listFilesExample
#+begin_src R
  list.files("dataSets") # list files in the dataSets folder
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: listFilesExample
#+begin_example
> list.files("dataSets") # list files in the dataSets folder
[1] "babyNames.csv"
> 
#+end_example

** Readers for common file types

In order to read data from a file, you have to know what kind of file it is. The table below lists the functions that can import data from common file formats.

| data type               | function     | package                                             |
|-------------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| comma separated (.csv)  | read_csv()   | readr (tidyverse)                                   |
| other delimited formats | read_delim() | readr (tidyverse)                                   |
| R (.Rds)                | read_rds()   | readr (tidyverse)                                                    |
| Stata (.dta)            | read_stata() | haven (tidyverse, needs to be attached separately)  |
| SPSS (.sav)             | read_spss()  | haven (tidyverse, needs to be attached separately)  |
| SAS (.sas7bdat)         | read_sas()   | haven (tidyverse, needs to be attached separately)  |
| Excel (.xls, .xlsx)     | read_excel   | readxl (tidyverse, needs to be attached separately) |
|-------------------------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------------|


** Exercise 2
The purpose of this exercise is to practice reading data into R. The data in "=dataSets/babyNames.csv=" is moderately tricky to read, making it a good data set to practice on. 

1. Open the help page for the =read_csv= function. How can you limit the number of rows to be read in?
2. Read just the first 10 rows of "=dataSets/babyNames.csv=". Notice that the "Sex" column has been read as a logical (TRUE/FALSE).
3. Read the =read_csv= help page to figure out how to make it read the "Sex" column as a character. Make adjustments to your code until you have read in the first 10 rows with the correct column types. "Year" and "Name.length" should be integer (int), "Count" and "Percent" should be double (dbl) and everything else should be character (chr).
4. Once you have successfully read in the first 10 rows, read the whole file, assigning the result to the name =baby.names=.

** Exercise 2 solution                                            :prototype:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  ## read ?read_csv
  ## limit rows with n_max argument

  ## specify column types in the col_types argument
  read_csv("dataSets/babyNames.csv", n_max = 10, col_types = "??c????")
  
  ## read all the data
  baby.names <- read_csv("dataSets/babyNames.csv", col_types = "??c????")
#+END_SRC

* Data Manipulation

** data.frame objects
Usually data read into R will be stored as a *data.frame*

- A data.frame is a list of vectors of equal length
  - Each vector in the list forms a column
  - Each column can be a differnt type of vector
  - Typically columns are variables and the rows are observations

A data.frame has two dimensions corresponding the number of rows and the number of columns (in that order)

** Slice and Filter data.frames rows

You can extract subsets of data.frames using =slice= to select rows by number and =filter= to select rows that match some condition. It works like this:

#+name: indexingDataFrame
#+begin_src R 
  ## make up some example data
  (example.df <- data.frame(id  = rep(letters[1:4], each = 4),
                            t   = rep(1:4, times = 4),
                            var1 = runif(16),
                            var2 = sample(letters[1:3], 16, replace = TRUE)))

  ## rows 2 and 4
  slice(example.df, c(2, 4))

  ## rows where id == "a"
  filter(example.df, id == "a")

  ## rows where id is either "a" or "b"
  filter(example.df, id %in% c("a", "b"))

#+end_src

+                           var1 = runif(16),

** Select data.frame columns

=slice= and =filter= are used to extract rows. =select= is used to extract columns
#+begin_src R

You can also conveniently select a single column using =$=, like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  example.df$t
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> example.df$t
 [1] 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
> 
#+end_example

Data manipulation commands can be combined:

#+BEGIN_SRC R 
  filter(select(example.df,
                id,
                var1),
         id == "a")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> filter(select(example.df,
+               id,
+               var1),
+        id == "a")
  id      var1
1  a 0.1915825
2  a 0.4692183
3  a 0.7109248
4  a 0.8189291
> 
#+end_example

In the previous example we used == to filter rows where id was "a". Other relational and logical operators are listed below.

| Operator | Meaning                  |
|----------+--------------------------|
| ==       | equal to                 |
| !=       | not equal to             |
| >        | greater than             |
| >=       | greater than or equal to |
| <        | less than                |
| <=       | less than or equal to    |
| %in%     | contained in             |
| &        | and                      |
| \vert    | or                       |

** Adding, removing, and modifying data.frame columns

You can modify data.frames using the =mutate()= function. It works like this:

#+name: replaceDataFrame
#+begin_src R 
  example.df

  ## modify example.df and assign the modified data.frame the name example.df
  example.df <- mutate(example.df,
         var2 = var1/t, # replace the values in var2
         var3 = 1:length(t), # create a new column named var3

** Exercise 3: Data manipulation
Read in the "babyNames.csv" file if you have not already done so, assigning the result to =baby.names=.

1. Filter =baby.names= to show only names given to at least 3 percent of boys.
2. Create a column named "Proportion" equal to Percent divided by 100.
3. Filter =baby.names= to include only names given to at least 3 percent of Girls. Save this to a Stata data set named "popularGirlNames.dta")

** Exercise 3 solution :prototype:

* Basic Statistics and Graphs

** Basic statistics

Descriptive statistics of single variables are straightforward:
#+name: descriptiveStats1
#+begin_src R
 
  sum(example.df$var1) # calculate sum of var 1
  mean(example.df$var1)
  median(example.df$var1)
  sd(example.df$var1) # calculate standard deviation of var1
  var(example.df$var1)

  ## summaries of individual columns
  summary(example.df$var1)
  summary(example.df$var2)

  ## summary of whole data.frame
  summary(example.df)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: descriptiveStats1

Some of these functions (e.g., summary) will also work with data.frames and other types of objects, others (such as =sd=) will not.

** Statistics by grouping variable(s)

The =summarize= function can be used to calculate statistics by grouping variable. Here is how it works.

#+BEGIN_SRC R 
  summarize(group_by(example.df, id), mean(var1), sd(var1))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> summarize(group_by(example.df, id), mean(var1), sd(var1))
# A tibble: 4 × 3
      id `mean(var1)` `sd(var1)`
  <fctr>        <dbl>      <dbl>
1      a    0.5476637  0.2787990
2      b    0.4448132  0.3493286

4      d    0.2442806  0.1805739
> 
#+end_example

You can group by multiple variables:

#+BEGIN_SRC R 
  summarize(group_by(example.df, id, var3), mean(var1), sd(var1))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

** Save R output to a file
Earlier we learned how to write a data set to a file. But what if we want to write something that isn't in a nice rectangular format, like the output of =summary=? For that we can use the ~sink()~ function:

#+name: sinkExample
#+begin_src R
  sink(file="output.txt", split=TRUE) # start logging
  print("This is the summary of example.df \n")
  print(summary(example.df))
  sink() ## sink with no arguments turns logging off
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: sinkExample
#+begin_example
> sink(file="output.txt", split=TRUE) # start logging
> print("This is the summary of example.df \n")
[1] "This is the summary of example.df \n"

** Exercise 4

1. Calculate the total number of children born.
2. Filter the data to extract only Massachusetts (Location "MA"), and calculate the total number of children born in Massachusetts.
3. Group and summarize the data to calculate the number of children born each year.
4. Calculate the average number of characters in baby names (using the "Name.length" column).
5. Group and summarize to calculate the average number of characters in baby names for each location.
