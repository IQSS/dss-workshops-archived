*** Lab computer users: Log in using your Athena user name and password. :mitsetup:

*** Laptop users: You should have R installed --if not:
**** Open a web browser and go to [[http://cran.r-project.org]] and download and install it
**** Also helpful to install RStudio (download from [[http://rstudio.com]])

*** Everyone: Download workshop materials:
**** Download materials from [[http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rintro.zip]]

** What is R?
R is a programming language designed for statistical computing. Notable characteristics include:

- Vast capabilities, wide range of statistical and graphical techniques

- Very popular in academia, growing popularity in business: [[http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/]]

- Written primarily by statisticians

- FREE (no cost, open source)

- Excellent community support: mailing list, blogs, tutorials

- Easy to extend by writing new functions

** InspiRation 
OK, it's free and popular, but what makes R worth learning? In a word,
"packages". If you have a data manipulation, analysis or visualization
task, chances are good that there is an R package for that. For example:

- Want to interactively explore the shape of the Churyumov–Gerasimenko comet?
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent
  library(rgl)
  open3d()
  comet <- readOBJ(url("http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/doc.cfm?fobjectid=54726"))
  shade3d(comet, col="gray")
  writeWebGL(dir="images", filename = "images/comet.html")
#+END_SRC

#+HTML: <iframe src="images/comet.html" width=600 height=350 scrolling=no seamless></iframe>

- Want to find out where we are?
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :width 600 :height 600 :file images/hereweare.png
  library(ggmap)
  nwbuilding <- geocode("52 Oxford Street, Cambridge, MA") 
  ggmap(get_map("Cambridge, MA", zoom = 15)) +
    geom_point(data=nwbuilding, size = 7, shape = 13, color = "red")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/hereweare.png]]

- Want to forecast the population of Australia?
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  library(forecast)
  fit <- auto.arima(austres)
  ## Projected numbers (in thousands) of Australian residents
  summary(forecast(fit))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

#+end_example

These a just a few examples, but generally whatever you're trying to do, you're probably not the first to try doing it R, and chances are good that someone has already written a package for that.

** Coming to R
Comming from...
#+LATEX: {\footnotesize
- Stata :: http://www.princeton.edu/~otorres/RStata.pdf
- SAS/SPSS :: http://www.et.bs.ehu.es/~etptupaf/pub/R/RforSAS&SPSSusers.pdf 
- matlab :: http://www.math.umaine.edu/~hiebeler/comp/matlabR.pdf
- Python :: http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-python-xref.pdf
#+LATEX: }

* Graphical User Interfaces


** R GUI alternatives (no GUI)

The old-school way is to run R directly in a terminal

#+attr_html: width="75%"
#+attr_latex: :width .75\textwidth
[[file:images/Rconsole.png]]

But hardly anybody does it that way anymore!


** R GUI alternatives (Windows default)

#+attr_html: width="75%"
#+attr_latex: :width .75\textwidth
[[file:images/Rgui.png]]

The default windows GUI is not very good
  - No parentheses matching or syntax highlighting
  - No work-space browser


** R GUI Alternatives (Rstudio on Mac)
#+attr_html: width="75%"
#+attr_latex: :width .75\textwidth
[[file:images/Rstudio.png]]

Rstudio has many useful features, including parentheses matching and auto-completion


** R GUI Alternatives (Emacs with ESS)
#+attr_html: width="75%"
#+attr_latex: :width .65\textwidth
[[file:images/emacs.png]]

Emacs + ESS is a very powerful combination, but can be difficult to set up


** Launch RStudio on Athena					   :mitsetup:

- To start R *type these commands in the terminal*:
:     add r
:     rstudio
- Open up today's R script

  - In RStudio, Go to *File => Open Script*

  - Locate and open the =Rintro.R= script in the Rintro folder in your home directory

- Go to *Tools => Set working directory => To source file location* (more on the working directory later)

- I encourage you to add your own notes to this file!


** Launch RStudio 						   :labsetup:

- Open the RStudio program

- Open up today's R script

  - In RStudio, Go to *File => Open Script*

  - Locate and open the =Rintro.R= script in the Rintro folder on your desktop

- Go to *Tools => Set working directory => To source file location* (more on the working directory later)

- I encourage you to add your own notes to this file!

** Things to keep in mind

- Case sensitive, like Stata (unlike SAS)

- Comments can be put almost anywhere, starting with a hash mark ('=#='); everything to the end of the line is a comment

- The command prompt "=>=" indicates that R is ready to receive commands

- If a command is not complete at the end of a line, R will give a different prompt, '=+=' by default

- Parentheses must always match (first thing to check if you get an error)

- R Does not care about spaces between commands or arguments

- Names should start with a letter and should not contain spaces

- Can use "." in object names (e.g., "my.data")

- Use forward slash ("/") instead of backslash in path names, even on Windows


** Exercise 0
1. Try to get R to add 2 plus 2.
2. Try to figure out how evaluate lines directly from your R script.
3. R includes extensive documentation, including a file named "An introduction to R". Try to find this help file.
4. Go to [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/]] and skim the topic closest to your field/interests.


* Data and Functions

** Assignment

Values can be assigned names and used in subsequent operations
- The ~<-~ operator (less than followed by a dash) is used to save values
- The name on the left gets the value on the right.

#+name: firstRExample
#+begin_src R 
  x <- 11 # Assign the value 10 to a variable named x
  x + 1 # Add 1 to x
  y <- x + 1 # Assign y the value x + 1
  y
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: firstRExample
#+begin_example
> x <- 11 # Assign the value 10 to a variable named x
> x + 1 # Add 1 to x
[1] 12
> y <- x + 1 # Assign y the value x + 1
> y
[1] 12
> 
#+end_example


Saved variables can be listed, overwritten and deleted
#+name: listOverwriteDelete
#+begin_src R
  ls() # List variables in workspace
  x # Print the value of x
  x <- 100 # Overwrite x. Note that no warning is given!
  x
  rm(x) # Delete x
  ls()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: listOverwriteDelete
#+begin_example
> ls() # List variables in workspace
[1] "x" "y"
> x # Print the value of x
[1] 11
> x <- 100 # Overwrite x. Note that no warning is given!
> x
[1] 100
> rm(x) # Delete x
> ls()
[1] "y"
> 
#+end_example


** Functions
Using R is mostly about applying *functions* to *variables*. Functions
  - take *variable(s)* as input *argument(s)*
  - perform operations
  - *return* values which can be *assigned*
  - optionally perform side-effects such as writing a file to disk or opening a graphics window

The general form for calling R functions is 
  src_R[:exports code :eval no]{FunctionName(arg.1, arg.2, ... arg.n)}

Arguments can be matched by position or name

Examples:
#+name: functionExamples
#+begin_src R
  #?sqrt
  a <- sqrt(y) # Call the sqrt function with argument x=y
  round(a, digits = 2) # Call round() with arguments x=x and digits=2
  # Functions can be nested so an alternative is
  round(sqrt(y), digits = 5) # Take sqrt of a and round
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: functionExamples
#+begin_example
> #?sqrt
> a <- sqrt(y) # Call the sqrt function with argument x=y
> round(a, digits = 2) # Call round() with arguments x=x and digits=2
[1] 3.46
> # Functions can be nested so an alternative is
> round(sqrt(y), digits = 5) # Take sqrt of a and round
[1] 3.4641
> 
#+end_example


* Help and package management
  
** Asking R for help
R has extensive built-in documentation that can be accessed through R commands or through the GUI.
- Start html help, search/browse using web browser
  - at the R console:
    src_R[:exports code :eval no]{help.start()}

  - or use the help menu from you GUI

- Look up the documentation for a function
  src_R[:exports code :eval no]{help(plot)}

  src_R[:exports code :eval no]{?kmeans}

- Look up documentation for a package
  src_R[:exports code :eval no]{help(package="stats")}

- Search documentation from R (not always the best way... google often works better)
  src_R[:exports code :eval no]{help.search("classification")}

** R packages and libraries

There are thousands of R packages that extend R's capabilities.

- To view available packages: 
  src_R[:exports code :eval no]{library()}

- To see what packages are loaded: 
  src_R[:exports code :eval no]{search()}

- To load a package: 
  src_R[:exports code :eval no]{library("car")}

- Install new package: 
  src_R[:exports code :eval no]{install.packages("stringdist")}


* Getting data into R
  

** The gss dataset
  The next few examples use a subset of the General Social Survey data set. The variables in this subset include
#+name: GSSinfo
#+begin_src R
  head(read.csv("dataSets/gssInfo.csv")) 
  #see gssInfo.csv for rest of the variable descriptions
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: GSSinfo
#+begin_example
> head(read.csv("dataSets/gssInfo.csv")) 
      var                      description
1 marital                   marital status
2     age                age of respondent
3    educ highest year of school completed
4     sex                  respondents sex
5     inc               respondents income
6   happy                general happiness
> #see gssInfo.csv for rest of the variable descriptions
> 
#+end_example

** The "working directory" and listing files
 R knows the directory it was started in, and refers to this as the "working directory". Since our workshop examples are in the Rintro folder on the desktop, we should all take a moment to set that as our working directory:
#+name: SetDesktopWorkingDirectory
#+begin_src R :eval no
  setwd("~/Desktop/Rintro")
#+end_src

We can also set the working directory using paths relative to the current working directory:

#+name: getWD
#+begin_src R
  getwd() # get the current working directory
  setwd("dataSets") # set wd to the dataSets folder
  getwd()
  setwd("..") # set wd to enclosing folder ("up")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: getWD
#+begin_example
> getwd() # get the current working directory
[1] "/home/izahn/Documents/Work/IQSS/Classes/IQSS_Stats_Workshops/R/Rintro"
> setwd("dataSets") # set wd to the dataSets folder
> getwd()
[1] "/home/izahn/Documents/Work/IQSS/Classes/IQSS_Stats_Workshops/R/Rintro/dataSets"
> setwd("..") # set wd to enclosing folder ("up")
> 
#+end_example

 It can be convenient to list files in a directory without leaving R
#+name: listFilesExample
#+begin_src R
  list.files("dataSets") # list files in the dataSets folder
  # list.files("dataSets", pattern = ".csv") # restrict to .csv files  
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: listFilesExample
#+begin_example
> list.files("dataSets") # list files in the dataSets folder
 [1] "gss.csv"            "gss.dta"            "gssInfo.csv"       
 [4] "gss.rds"            "gss.sas7bdat"       "gss.sav"           
 [7] "gss.xlsx"           "statesCodebook.txt" "states.csv"        
[10] "states.dta"         "states.xlsx"       
> # list.files("dataSets", pattern = ".csv") # restrict to .csv files  
> 
#+end_example


** Importing data from files
In order to read data from a file, you have to know what kind of file it is. The table below lists the functions needed to import data from common file formats.

| data type               | function                | package         |
|-------------------------+-------------------------+-----------------|
| comma separated (.csv)  | read.csv()              | utils (default) |
| other delimited formats | read.table()            | utils (default) |
| Stata (.dta)            | read.dta()              | foreign         |
| SPSS (.sav)             | read.spss()             | foreign         |
| SAS (.sas7bdat)         | read.sas7bdat()         | sas7bdat        |
| Excel (.xls, .xlsx)     | readWorksheetFromFile() | XLConnect       |
|-------------------------+-------------------------+-----------------|

Examples:
#+name: readRDS
#+begin_src R
  # read gss data from the gss.rds R file
  datGSS <- readRDS("dataSets/gss.rds")
  # read gss data from the gss.csv comma separated file
  gss.data <- read.csv("dataSets/gss.csv") # read gss data
  # read a Stata dataset from gss.dta 
  library(foreign) # load foreign data functions
  datGSS <- read.dta(file="dataSets/gss.dta")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: readRDS
#+begin_example
> # read gss data from the gss.rds R file
> datGSS <- readRDS("dataSets/gss.rds")
> # read gss data from the gss.csv comma separated file
> gss.data <- read.csv("dataSets/gss.csv") # read gss data
> # read a Stata dataset from gss.dta 
> library(foreign) # load foreign data functions
> datGSS <- read.dta(file="dataSets/gss.dta")
> 
#+end_example


** Checking imported data

 Always a good idea  to examine the imported data set--usually we want the results to be a ~data.frame~
#+name: ExamineStataData
#+begin_src R
  class(datGSS) # check to see that test is what we expect it to be
  dim(datGSS) # how many rows and columns?
  names(datGSS)[1:10] # first 10 column names
  str(datGSS[1:5]) # more details about the first 5 columns
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: ExamineStataData
#+begin_example
> class(datGSS) # check to see that test is what we expect it to be
[1] "data.frame"
> dim(datGSS) # how many rows and columns?
[1] 1419   35
> names(datGSS)[1:10] # first 10 column names
 [1] "age"      "educ"     "emailhrs" "hrs1"     "sex"      "usecomp" 
 [7] "usemail"  "useweb"   "webhrs"   "hapmar"  
> str(datGSS[1:5]) # more details about the first 5 columns
'data.frame':	1419 obs. of  5 variables:
 $ age     : num  69 27 19 21 19 87 42 19 78 70 ...
 $ educ    : num  12 10 11 9 11 8 11 11 7 9 ...
 $ emailhrs: num  -1 -1 0 -1 50 -1 3 -1 -1 -1 ...
 $ hrs1    : num  -1 60 32 20 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 22 ...
 $ sex     : Factor w/ 2 levels "Male","Female": 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 ...
> 
#+end_example


** Saving and loading R  workspaces
In addition to importing individual datasets, R can save and load entire workspaces
- Save our entire workspace
#+name: saveDelete
#+begin_src R 
  ls() # list objects in our workspace
  save.image(file="myWorkspace.RData") # save workspace 
  rm(list=ls()) # remove all objects from our workspace 
  ls() # list stored objects to make sure they are deleted
  
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: saveDelete
#+begin_example
> ls() # list objects in our workspace
[1] "a"        "datGSS"   "gss.data" "y"       
> save.image(file="myWorkspace.RData") # save workspace 
> rm(list=ls()) # remove all objects from our workspace 
> ls() # list stored objects to make sure they are deleted
character(0)
> 
#+end_example

- Load the "myWorkspace.RData" file and check that it is restored

#+name: loadList
#+begin_src R
  load("myWorkspace.RData") # load myWorkspace.RData
  ls() # list objects
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: loadList
#+begin_example
> load("myWorkspace.RData") # load myWorkspace.RData
> ls() # list objects
[1] "a"        "datGSS"   "gss.data" "y"       
> 
#+end_example

When you close R you will be asked if you want to save your workspace -- if you choose yes then your workspace will be restored next time you start R


** Exercise 1

1. Load the foreign package if you haven't already done so

2. Look at the help page for the read.spss function

3. Read the SPSS data set in dataSets/gss.sav and assign the result to an R data object named GSS.sav

4. Make sure that the data loaded in step 2 is a data.frame (hint: check the arguments documented in the help page)

5. Display the dimensions of the GSS.sav. 

6. BONUS: figure out how to read the Excel file "gss.xlsx" into R


* Data Manipulation

** data.frame objects
- Usually data read into R will be stored as a *data.frame*

- A data.frame is a list of vectors of equal length
  - Each vector in the list forms a column
  - Each column can be a differnt type of vector
  - Often the columns are variables and the rows are observations

- A data.frame has two dimensions corresponding the number of rows and the number of columns (in that order)

** data.frame meta-data
 A number of functions are available for inspecting data.frame objects:

#+name: getAttributes
#+begin_src R
  # row and column names
  head(names(datGSS)) # variable names in datGSS
  head(rownames(datGSS)) # first few rownames of datGSS
  # dimensions
  dim(datGSS)
  # structure
  #str(datGSS) # get structure
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: getAttributes
#+begin_example
> # row and column names
> head(names(datGSS)) # variable names in datGSS
[1] "age"      "educ"     "emailhrs" "hrs1"     "sex"      "usecomp" 
> head(rownames(datGSS)) # first few rownames of datGSS
[1] "1" "2" "3" "4" "5" "6"
> # dimensions
> dim(datGSS)
[1] 1419   35
> # structure
> #str(datGSS) # get structure
> 
#+end_example


** Logical operators
It is often useful to select just those rows of your data where some condition holds--for example select only rows where sex is 1 (male). The following operators allow you to do this:

- == :: equal to 
- != :: not equal to
- > :: greater than
- < :: less than
- >= :: greater than or equal to
- <= :: less than or equal to
- & :: and
- | :: or

Note the double equals signs for testing equality. The following example show how to use some of these operators to extract and replace elements matching specific conditions.


** Extracting subsets of data.frames

You can extract subsets of data.frames using the =subset()= function.

#+name: indexingDataFrame
#+begin_src R 
  # extracting subsets
  subset(datGSS,
         # rows 1 through 3
         subset = rownames(datGSS) %in% 1:3,
         # column 1 to 5
         select = 1:4)
                                          
  subset(datGSS,
         # rows where age > 90
         subset = age > 90,
         ## sex and age columns
         select = c("sex", "age"))

  ## the $ operator can be used to extract a single column
  str(datGSS$age)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: indexingDataFrame
#+begin_example
> # extracting subsets
> subset(datGSS,
+        # rows 1 through 3
+        subset = rownames(datGSS) %in% 1:3,
+        # column 1 to 5
+        select = 1:4)
  age educ emailhrs hrs1
1  69   12       -1   -1
2  27   10       -1   60
3  19   11        0   32
>                                         
> subset(datGSS,

Note that =subset()= is a convenience function; see =?Extract= for a more powerful (and complicated) way to subset data.

** Transforming data.frames

You can modify data.frames using the =transform()= function. 

#+name: replaceDataFrame
#+begin_src R 
  # creating new variable mean centered age
  datGSS <- transform(datGSS,
                      ageC = age - mean(age))

   #education difference between wifes and husbands
  datGSS <- transform(datGSS,
                      educ.diff = wifeduc - husbeduc)

  ## ifelse() is also useful; note that the $ operator can
  ## also be used to create new variables.
  datGSS$young <- ifelse(datGSS$age < 30, "yes", "no")

  ## examine our newly created variables
  head(subset(datGSS,
              select = c("age", "ageC", "young", "wifeduc",
                         "husbeduc", "educ.diff")),
       n = 8)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: replaceDataFrame

** Exporting Data
Now that we have made some changes to our GSS data set, we might want to save those changes to a file. Everything we have done so far has only modified the data in R; the files have remained unchanged. 

#+name: dataExportExamples
#+begin_src R
  # write data to a .csv file
  write.csv(datGSS, file = "gss.csv")
  # write data to a Stata file
  write.dta(datGSS, file = "gss.dta")
  # write data to an R file
  saveRDS(datGSS, file = "gss.rds")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: dataExportExamples
#+begin_example
> # write data to a .csv file
> write.csv(datGSS, file = "gss.csv")
> # write data to a Stata file
> write.dta(datGSS, file = "gss.dta")
> # write data to an R file
> saveRDS(datGSS, file = "gss.rds")
> 
#+end_example


** Exercise 2: Data manipulation
Use the gss.rds data set

1. Generate the following variables:
   - "rich" equal to 0 if rincdol is less than 100000, and 1 otherwise
   - "sinc" equal to incomdol - rincdol
2. Create a subset of the data containing only rows where "usecomp" = "Yes"
3. Examine the data.frame created in step 2, and answer the following questions:
   - How many rows does it have?
   - How many columns does it have?
   - What is the class of the "satjob" variable?
4. BONUS (hard): Generate a variable named "dual.earn" equal to 1 if both wkftwife = 1 and wkfthusb = 1, and zero otherwise



* Basic Statistics and Graphs

** Basic statistics

Descriptive statistics of single variables are straightforward:
#+name: descriptiveStats1
#+begin_src R
  mean(datGSS$educ) # calculate mean value of education
  sd(datGSS$educ) # calculate standard deviation of x
  # calculate min, max, quantiles, mean of educ, age, and ageC
  summary(subset(datGSS, select = c("educ", "age", "ageC")))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: descriptiveStats1
#+begin_example
> mean(datGSS$educ) # calculate mean value of education
[1] 13.47498
> sd(datGSS$educ) # calculate standard deviation of x
[1] 5.389476
> # calculate min, max, quantiles, mean of educ, age, and ageC
> summary(subset(datGSS, select = c("educ", "age", "ageC")))
      educ            age             ageC        
 Min.   : 0.00   Min.   :18.00   Min.   :-28.636  
 1st Qu.:12.00   1st Qu.:32.00   1st Qu.:-14.636  
 Median :13.00   Median :44.00   Median : -2.636  
 Mean   :13.47   Mean   :46.64   Mean   :  0.000  
 3rd Qu.:16.00   3rd Qu.:59.00   3rd Qu.: 12.364  
 Max.   :99.00   Max.   :99.00   Max.   : 52.364  
> 
#+end_example


Some of these functions (e.g., summary) will also work with data.frames and other types of objects, others (such as =sd=) will not.

** Counts and proportions
Start by using the ~table()~ function to tabulate counts, then perform additional computations if needed
#+name: tableExample
#+begin_src R
  sex.counts <- table(datGSS$sex) # tabulate sex categories
  sex.counts
  prop.table(sex.counts) # convert to proportions
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: tableExample
#+begin_example
> sex.counts <- table(datGSS$sex) # tabulate sex categories
> sex.counts

  Male Female 
   622    797 
> prop.table(sex.counts) # convert to proportions

     Male    Female 
0.4383369 0.5616631 
> 
#+end_example

Add variables for crosstabs

#+name: crosstabExample
#+begin_src R
  table(subset(datGSS, select = c("sex", "happy"))) # crosstab marital X happy
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: crosstabExample
#+begin_example
> table(subset(datGSS, select = c("sex", "happy"))) # crosstab marital X happy
        happy
sex      NAP VERY HAPPY PRETTY HAPPY NOT TOO HAPPY  DK  NA
  Male     0        189          350            73   0  10
  Female   0        246          447            84   1  19
> 
#+end_example



** Statistics by classification factors
The ~by()~ function can be used to perform a calculation separately for each level of a classifying variable
#+name: byExample
#+begin_src R 
  by(subset(datGSS, select = c("income", "educ")),
     INDICES=datGSS["sex"],
     FUN=summary)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: byExample
#+begin_example
> by(subset(datGSS, select = c("income", "educ")),
+    INDICES=datGSS["sex"],
+    FUN=summary)
sex: Male
             income         educ      
 $40000 TO 49999: 59   Min.   : 4.00  
 $50000 TO 59999: 56   1st Qu.:12.00  
 $60000 TO 74999: 49   Median :13.00  
 $35000 TO 39999: 48   Mean   :13.68  
 REFUSED        : 48   3rd Qu.:16.00  
 $110000 OR OVER: 43   Max.   :99.00  
 (Other)        :319                  
---------------------------------------------------- 
sex: Female
             income         educ      
 REFUSED        : 76   Min.   : 0.00  
 $60000 TO 74999: 62   1st Qu.:12.00  
 $40000 TO 49999: 60   Median :12.00  
 $50000 TO 59999: 52   Mean   :13.32  
 $30000 TO 34999: 49   3rd Qu.:15.00  
 $25000 TO 29999: 42   Max.   :99.00  
 (Other)        :456                  
> 
#+end_example

** Correlations

Let's look at correlations among between age, income, and education
#+name: corEx
#+begin_src R 
  cor(subset(datGSS, select =  c("age", "incomdol", "educ")))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: corEx
#+begin_example
> cor(subset(datGSS, select =  c("age", "incomdol", "educ")))
                 age   incomdol        educ
age       1.00000000 -0.1186564 -0.07362454
incomdol -0.11865641  1.0000000  0.21013267
educ     -0.07362454  0.2101327  1.00000000
> 
#+end_example


For significance tests, use cor.test()
#+name: corTest
#+begin_src R 
  with(datGSS,
       cor.test(age, educ))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: corTest
#+begin_example
> with(datGSS,
+      cor.test(age, educ))

	Pearson's product-moment correlation

** Multiple regression

Modeling functions generally use the /formula/ interface whith DV on left followed by "~" followed by predictors--for details see
src_R[:exports code :eval no]{help("formula")}

- Predict the number of hours individuals spend on email (emailhrs)
#+name: regression
#+begin_src R 
  m1 <- lm(educ ~ sex + age, data = datGSS)
  summary(m1)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: regression
#+begin_example
> m1 <- lm(educ ~ sex + age, data = datGSS)
> summary(m1)

Call:
lm(formula = educ ~ sex + age, data = datGSS)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
-13.434  -1.785  -0.688   1.955  86.049

** Save R output to a file
Earlier we learned how to write a data set to a file. But what if we want to write something that isn't in a nice rectangular format, like the results of our regression model? For that we can use the ~sink()~ function:

#+name: sinkExample
#+begin_src R
  sink(file="output.txt", split=TRUE) # start logging
  print("This is the result from model 1\n")
  print(summary(m1))
  sink() ## sink with no arguments turns logging off
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: sinkExample
#+begin_example
> sink(file="output.txt", split=TRUE) # start logging
> print("This is the result from model 1\n")
[1] "This is the result from model 1\n"
> print(summary(m1))

Call:
lm(formula = educ ~ sex + age, data = datGSS)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
-13.434  -1.785  -0.688   1.955  86.049 

Coefficients:
             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept) 14.652702   0.425691  34.421  < 2e-16
sexFemale   -0.275235   0.289290  -0.951  0.34156
age         -0.021938   0.008238  -2.663  0.00783

Residual standard error: 5.377 on 1416 degrees of freedom
