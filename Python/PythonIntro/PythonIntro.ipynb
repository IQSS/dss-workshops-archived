    "###  Install the Anaconda Python distribution\n",
    "If using your own computer please install the Anaconda Python distribution from [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). (Note that Python version$\\leq$ 3.0 differs considerably from more recent releases. For this workshop you will need version$\\geq$ 3.4.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Accepting the defaults proposed by the Anaconda installer is generally recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download workshop materials\n",
    "Download the materials from [http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/Python/PythonIntro.zip](http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/Python/PythonIntro.zip) and extract the zipped directory (Right-click => Extract All on Windows, double-click on Mac).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Launch Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Start the `Anaconda Navigator` program in the usual way. Click the or `Launch` button under `Jupyter Notebook`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workshop goals and approach\n",
    "In this workshop you will\n",
    "- learn about the python package and application ecosystem,\n",
    "- learn python language basics and common idioms, and,\n",
    "- practice reading files and manipulating data in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more general goal is to get you comfortable with Python so that it seems less scary and mystifying than it perhaps does now. Note that this is by no means a complete or thorough introduction to Python! It's just enough to get by.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop is relatively *informal*, *example-oriented*, and *hands-on*. We won't spend much time examining language features in detail. Instead we will work through an example, and learn some things about the language along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example project we will analyze the text of Lewis Carroll's *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*. Among the questions we will use Python to answer are:\n",
    "- How many total and unique words are there?\n",
    "- How many chapters and paragraphs?\n",
    "- How many words are in each chapter, and what is the average words per chapter?\n",

    "Python is a relatively easy to learn general purpose programming language. People use Python to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data, make web sites, write games, and much more. Youtube, DropBox, and BitTorrent are among the things people used python to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most popular open source programming languages, Python can be thought of as a *platform* that runs a huge number and variety of packages. The language itself is mostly valuable because it makes it easy to create and use a large number of useful packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I interact with Python?\n",
    "A number of interfaces designed to make it easy to interact with Python are available. The Anaconda distribution that we installed earlier includes both a web-based *Jupyter Notebook* and a more conventional Integrated Development Environment called *Spyder*. For this workshop I encourage you to use *Jupyter Notebook*. In real life you should experiment and choose the interface that you find most comfortable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, start the *Jupyter Notebook* application, and navigate to the *PythonIntro* directory you downloaded and extracted earlier. Start a new notebook by clicking `New => Python 3` as shown below.\n",
