    "This notebook shows how to use public cloud services for data augmententation of widely available data source. The data will be used to predict candidates' odds of winning the presidential election. You are going to collect the data avaialble using some dependencies(i.e. pytube, pydub and cv2) that will allow you to download presidential' campaign Ads video, reduce them in smaller audio files, and extract frames too. Then you will use public cloud servicese using REST API to convert audio to text, to analyze the extracted text and frames contents. You are going to use cognitive services, text analytics, speech recognition and optical character recognition among the most powerful tools for data augmentation offered by Azure Microsoft public cloud. By using these tools you will increase the availability of data in your possess from a lagely available source: YouTube videos.\n",

    "**The experiment aim** is to demonstrate how public cloud services can be used in real applications to enhance social scientists research. In this respect we are going to use only an handful of video but keep in mind that you could repeat this experiment with all the video you want. The subject of the videos we selected is presidential campaign commercials that have been most influential, and you can find a link to them below. We estimate that completing this guide will take you around 10-15 minutes for reading, running the code and understanding how it works.\n",
