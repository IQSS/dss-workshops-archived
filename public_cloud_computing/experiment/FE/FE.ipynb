Using the files previously collected (see Experiment: Predict Elections Using Presidential Commercial Campaign - Data Collection - notebook), You are going to use cognitive services, text analytics, speech recognition and optical character recognition that are among the most powerful tools for data augmentation offered by Azure Microsoft public cloud. By using these tools you will increase the availability of data in your possess from a lagely available source: YouTube videos. This notebook ends with a an application of statistical tool with the aim of predicting presidential candidates likelihood of winning the presidential elections using principally campaign Ads from the past elections.\n",
