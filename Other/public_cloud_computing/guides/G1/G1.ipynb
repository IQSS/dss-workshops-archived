    "Public Cloud services are useful tools to store and analyze documents' contents as well as to extract and process data. If you have never used a public cloud, you've probably already used: uploading documents to remote platform (some popular ones are DropBox, Google Drive, etc), transcribing an audio (after a set of interviews), copying and pasting data from webpage' images (who did not do that, right?) are some example of services that have been automated on public clouds to offer an on demand service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft Azure is a platform that automates and enhances a lot of the tasks that arise when dealing with storing data, machine learning techniques and cluster computing (check major platforms' websites for a more comprehensive overview, here is a link to [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)). Azure is one of the top competitors for investments on public cloud services, (see [The Top 5 Cloud Computing Vendors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobevans1/2017/11/07/the-top-5-cloud-computing-vendors-1-microsoft-2-amazon-3-ibm-4-salesforce-5-sap/#3f1473c56f2e)) being the one with greater investments as estimated recentely.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to explain: a) cloud computing basics, b) how to sign in Microsoft Azure free services, c) how to deploy some cloud services (e.g. storage account, speech recognition, text analytics, etc.) both using REST APIs and web interface application (e.g. storage explorer). While some cognitive services are accessible from the studio, some are not so we have to poke around to exploit the most interisting services available for social scientists. We estimate that completing this guide will take you around 15-30 minutes for reading, Microsoft Azure set up and deploying services. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll go over the basics of some Microsoft Azure services, but we should point out that a *lot* of talented people have given tutorials, and we won't do any better than they have."

    "## Why should you use public cloud services?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ask different people, you'll get different answers, but one of the commonalities is that most people don't realize is that eventhough these services come with costs (i.e. both monetary and training), they provides great resources that social scientists should start exploring themself. Here are some highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ** You can use them “anytime, anywhere”: ** public cloud users can access, barely always, cloud services and keep their data stored safely in the infrastructure.\n",
    "- ** You won't *need* to plan far ahead for provisioning: ** public cloud users can use infinite computing and storaging resources available on demand. In this way, the user can offload some problems to the service provider such as mantaining both hardware and software.\n",
    "- ** You can buy what you need, when you need it: ** public cloud allows you to use services eliminating any sort of up-front commitment by Cloud user.\n",
    "- ** Public cloud allows teams to collaborate: ** Public cloud allows you to share data and collaborate more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Public cloud basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Computing refers to both the applications delivered as services over the Internet and the hardware/systems software in the datacenters that provide those services. The datacenter hardware and software is what we will call a _Cloud_. When a Cloud is made available to the public (through pay-as-you-go services), it is called a Public Cloud; the service being sold from the datacenter to the provider such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon or IBM (which might or not might be the same) called computing utility [[1](#Footnotes)] and the one sold from provider to user that we will refer as a web application or more in general a service. Current examples of public computing services include AmazonWeb Services, Google AppEngine, and Microsoft Azure. A differenet deployment system from the public is the private. The private Cloud refers to internal datacenters of a business or other organization that are not made available to the public. The figure below shows the roles of the people as users or providers of different layers of the Cloud.\n",

    "The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines cloud as [[2](#Footnotes)]:\n",
    "\n",
    "_“a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.”_\n",

    "\n",
    "![Iass_Paas_SaaS_image](img/Iass_Paas_SaaS_image.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    " - The Infrastructure as a Service (**IaaS**) is a cloud of resources provided to users. IaaS provides the basic functionality of storage and computing as service consisting in network servers, storage systems, network instrumentality, and information headquarters.\n",
    " - The Platform as a Service (**PaaS**) is a development environment provided as a service. These advanced levels of alternative service can be designed by end-users. PaaS offers virtualized servers that multiple users work on applications or grow innovative applications, with no having to concern about keeping operating systems, server hardware, equalization or weight power calculation.\n",
    " - The Software as a Service (**SaaS**) is an application that is offered to consumers using the Internetwork. A single case of service works in the cloud and multiple end users services. An example of Cloud Computing is Software as a Service (SaaS), where you input data on software and the data is transformed remotely through a software interface without your computer being involved. Thus SaaS eliminates client fears on storage, server applications, application development, and related common concerns of IT. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this to tutorial we are going to show you examples encompasses PaaS, when you will build the experiment using the two tutorials, and SaaS, when you will learn how to use the cloud services in the three guides.\n",

    "### Cloud pros and cons\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the advantages of using a cloud outperforms the disadvantage. When deciding to build your own application, which an example in this series of guides is the experiment, it is important to consider a couple of aspects: cloud security, and cloud service accuracy. In respect to the first, we reccomend making sure that data being stored in the cloud meet the requirements of your institution/research as well as checking the warranty of the chosen provider. In respect to the second, we suggest to consider the accuracy of the algorithm provided by the service for the purpose of the research but this fall outside the purpose of this workshop. Naeem et al.[[3](#Footnotes)] discusses some of the advantages and disadvantages when using cloud computing. We report them from their study in the chart below:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Disadvantages | Advantages |\n",
    "|:---:|:---:|\n",
    "| Security in the Cloud | Almost Unlimited Storage |\n",

To create your Azure account you will be asked to add your credentials as well as a credit card account.
